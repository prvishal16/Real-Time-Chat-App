INTRODUCTION
Our project is related to a new way of chatting with people. Chatting and
communicating with people through internet is becoming common to
people and is connecting people all over the world. Mainly, chatting apps
in today’s world mainly focus on connecting people, providing users with
more features like GIFs, stickers etc. But this app, is different from them.
This chatting application includes chatting through internet using IP
address. It mainly focuses on chatting and connects people all around the
world. Mostly, chatting applications like WhatsApp requires mobile no. of
the person and then we can chat and connect with the person. But here, the
person only has to login with the system, and then he can connect with the
people which he wants with.
The iDiscuss Chat app is an open - source chatting app. It means people
all over the world can join the chat between people easily. We can check
and see the people joining and leaving the chat group.
For using the app, firstly we have to register our name in the application.
After registration, the person will be given a particular IP address, which
is only used by that person, so that people will same name can be
differentiated easily. The IP address can only be seen by the person which
is registered under that name. Once, the registration of the person is done,
he can join the chat room.
The chatting between 2 people can be easily converted into group, as the
people chatting easily know if there is another person, who wants to join
the chat between them.
If we have to chat with a specific person, then we just have to know the
name of the person and its IP address. It’s different from the present
chatting applications, as it includes the personal information of the person,
which gets accessed by the person which is following him or is friends
with the person. This can save the person from sharing his personal stuff
to strangers, without his consent.
One of the features of this application is that, if a new person connects
with them while chatting in person or in group, then the app shows the
people the person is connecting or joining them while being in the group.
Not only group chatting, but personal chatting between people also takes
place.
Only during group chatting, people can enter the chat room. While
personal chatting, the chat and talk between people is kept encrypted
between them. In simple words, the chat between them cannot be read by
other people, not even by the app.
One of the important features of this app, is related to group chatting. If
for example, there are 2 groups in which there are 15 – 20 people. If more
than 5 people are common in both the groups, and an important message
or file is shared in one of the groups, then the person which shared the
information is asked whether the same information is to be shared in the
other group. If yes, then the information will be sent to the other group
directly, without any human interference. 


Objectives
 Easy login – in this app, we only need to add our name and then the
system will provide us an IP address, which will be used only by the
user under whose name it is registered.
 Open source – people which are interested to talk about a topic
which they like and people which are interested in it, can join and
communicate with others easily, as the chat is open sourced; which
means people can join and easily leave the chat room.
 Connects people globally – as the application runs through help of
internet, it helps in connecting people easily. Not only from a
particular country, but it can connect people all over the world.
 Different from normal chatting apps – iDiscuss chat app being bit
different from normal chatting applications, can attract people easily.
Not only because it takes less logging time, but also because it has
some features which are not available in current chatting
applications.
 Use of IP address – IP address is provided to the user, after logging
into the application. IP address provided to the user is unique, as they
can only be used by the user, which is assigned to it. This saves
duplication of information of user, which may have same name.
